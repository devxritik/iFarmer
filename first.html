                <p class="text-small">A farmer is an individual who engages in agriculture, raising crops, livestock, or both, as a primary means of livelihood. Farmers manage land, use tools and machinery, and apply knowledge of farming techniques to produce food, fiber, and other agricultural products. Their work involves tasks such as planting, cultivating, harvesting, animal husbandry, and maintaining farm equipment. Farmers play a crucial role in the food supply chain and the overall economy, contributing to food security and sustainability.</p>

        <p class="sectionTag text-big">Introducing Farmer</p>
        <p class="sectionSubTag text-small">A farmer is a person engaged in agriculture, raising living organisms for food or raw materials.The term usually applies to people who do some combination of raising field crops, orchards, vineyards, poultry, or other livestock. A farmer might own the farmland or might work as a laborer on land owned by others. In most developed economies, a "farmer" is usually a farm owner (landowner), while employees of the farm are known as farm workers (or farmhands). However, in other older definitions a farmer was a person who promotes or improves the growth of plants, land, or crops or raises animals (as livestock or fish) by labor and attention</p>
